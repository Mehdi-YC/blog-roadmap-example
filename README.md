this repo is my starter to full stack applications with all those libraries,
All what you have to do is

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mehdi-yc/sveltekit-dls
    cd sveltekit-dls
    npm i
    npm run dev
```

### docker-compose : 
if you want to also install the database with docker-compose (i choosed <b> Postgres</b>)

```sh
    docker-compose up -d
```
